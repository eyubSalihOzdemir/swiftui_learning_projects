## Project 1 - WeSplit

First project of iOS learning series using [Hacking with Swift](hackingwithswift.com)

A check-splitting app to find out what each person needs to pay.

I learned about the fundamental structure of XCode and Swift, how to get input, how does some of the views work (Button, Text, TextField, Form, NavigatonBar etc.) and how to deal with variable states (things like two-way bindings).

## Project 2 - Guess the Flag

An application makes you guess the flags and tells if it's correct or not.

I learned about very important widgets types such as VStack, HStack and ZStack. I learned how alerts work on iOS and played with the UI a little bit.

## Project 3 - Views and Modifiers

A technique project which focuses on how views and modifiers work. I've learned that Structs are more efficient because they do not have to rely on or inherit from any types of parents (unlike classes), they're a bit more restricting than classes so in a way thay're safer to deal with, easy to use and control. That's why SwiftUI relies heavily on structs other than classes. I learned that modifiers work by copies the existing view and wraps with the new feature we gave, so their use of order matters and they can be applied more than once to a view. I also made some code improvements change based on what I've learned on this project.
