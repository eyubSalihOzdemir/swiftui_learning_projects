## Project 1 - WeSplit

First project of iOS learning series using [Hacking with Swift](hackingwithswift.com)

A check-splitting app to find out what each person needs to pay.

I learned about the fundamental structure of XCode and Swift, how to get input, how does some of the views work (Button, Text, TextField, Form, NavigatonBar etc.) and how to deal with variable states (things like two-way bindings).

## Project 2 - Guess the Flag

An application makes you guess the flags and tells if it's correct or not.

I learned about very important widgets types such as VStack, HStack and ZStack. I learned how alerts work on iOS and played with the UI a little bit.
