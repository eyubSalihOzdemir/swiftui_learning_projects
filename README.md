## Project 1 - WeSplit

First project of iOS learning series using [Hacking with Swift](hackingwithswift.com)

A check-splitting app to find out what each person needs to pay.

I learned about the fundamental structure of **XCode** and **Swift**, how to get input, how does some of the views work **(Button, Text, TextField, Form, NavigatonBar etc.)** and how to deal with variable states (things like two-way **bindings**).

## Project 2 - Guess the Flag

An application makes you guess the flags and tells if it's correct or not.

I learned about very important widgets types such as **VStack**, **HStack** and **ZStack**. I learned how **alerts** work on iOS and played with the UI a little bit.

## Project 3 - Views and Modifiers

A technique project which focuses on **how views and modifiers work**. I've learned that **Structs** are more efficient because they do not have to rely on or inherit from any types of parents (unlike classes), they're a bit more restricting than classes so in a way thay're safer to deal with, easy to use and control. That's why SwiftUI relies heavily on structs other than classes. I learned that modifiers work by copies the existing view and wraps with the new feature we gave, so their **use of order matters** and they can be applied more than once to a view. I also made some code improvements change based on what I've learned on this project.

## Project 4 - BetterRest

I've always struggled with dates in Flutter, it was a nigtmare to deal with them. In this project I learned that it is so much easier, better and safer to make the framework do the calculations and logic on **Dates**. I learned about **CoreML** framework and **CreateML** application and used them to make a simple prediction about when the user should go to bed for desired amount of sleep.

## Project 5 - WordScramble

In this project I've learned about **List, onAppear modifier, what a Bundle is, fatalError() function, how to use UITextChecker and guard check**.

## Project 6 - Animations

I learned so much about animations. I'll probably forget about most of them but now I know how and where to look when I got something in my mind about animations. I used to have lots of problems in Flutter when it comes to animations but after this project I think if you can get a grasp of how Swift makes the animations work, it'll be a much easier process.

## Practice 1 - RockPaperScissors

It's a simple practice that's been made without tutorials to practice what I've learned so far. The applications choses a random move (rock, paper or scissors) and generates a result player should achieve (win or lose). Player then should make a move to achieve the desired result.
